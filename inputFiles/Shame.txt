In addition, they are unsure of who Omar's father is as the three sisters got pregnant at a house party. While growing up, Omar becomes mischievous and learns hypnosis. As a birthday present, Omar Khayyám Shakil's "mothers" allow him to leave "Q." He enrolls in a school and is convinced by his tutor (Eduardo Rodriguez) to become a doctor.
