Title: Wonders of the Invisible World
Author: Cotton Mather
Summary:
 Cotton Mather, narrator and preacher of the Second Church of Boston, begins with an explanation of the people of God and how they are living in the devil's territories. He discusses the devil's plan to overturn the plantation and churches with the help of his recruits, which Mather believes are witches. "...An army of devils is horribly broke in upon the place which is the center, and after a sort, the first-born of our English settlements... After explaining how the witch trials came about, Mather briefly prefaces the trials with a disclaimer. He adds that he will recount the truth as a historian and serve to retell the trials as they happened. The trials included names of the accused with testimonies of their strange behavior and actions from many people. One of the trials included is one of Martha Carrier, who was "the person of whom the confessions of the witches, and of her own children among the rest, agreed that the devil had promised her she should be Queen of the Hebrews.". Mather gives testimonies against Martha Carrier, all of which presume her to be guilty.
